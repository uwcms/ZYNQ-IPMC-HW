# This repository has been migrated to CERN Gitlab

This repository has been migrated to CERN Gitlab.

You may find it at https://gitlab.cern.ch/WisconsinCMS/IPMI/ZYNQ-IPMC-HW

To update your local copy of the repository to point to this project on CERN Gitlab, run the following command from within your repository folder:

```sh
# Update git to use the new repository URL:
git remote set-url origin ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/WisconsinCMS/IPMI/ZYNQ-IPMC-HW.git
```

If you have not already done so, you will need to set up your SSH key with CERN Gitlab (just as you did with Github) by visiting [this page](https://gitlab.cern.ch/-/profile/keys).

---

If this is a public repository and you do not wish to use SSH, you may instead run the following command to update your local copy:

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://gitlab.cern.ch/WisconsinCMS/IPMI/ZYNQ-IPMC-HW.git
```
